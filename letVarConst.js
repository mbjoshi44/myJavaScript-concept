// let and const have block scope.

// let and const can not be redeclared.

// let and const must be declared before use.

// let and const does not bind to this.

// let and const are not hoisted.

// let and const both are the part of  ES6(2015);
 // redeclared means
 // let x = "moti";

 // let x = 5;  not possible with let and const use with var;
 // block scope means;

 //{
    //let x = 30l

 //}
 // console.log(x);  not possible because out of scope


 // With let, redeclaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed:
 //var x = 2;   // Allowed
//let x = 3;   // Not allowed

//{
//let x = 2;   // Allowed
//let x = 3;   // Not allowed
//}

//{
//let x = 2;   // Allowed
//var x = 3;   // Not allowed
//}



//  console.log(name);  error Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initialization
  // console.log(newName);  //undefined
//  let name = "moti";
//var newName = "joshi" ;


// CONST

// connot be reassign , redecalar block scope
// Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

// Use const when you declare:

// A new Array
// A new Object
// A new Function
// A new RegExp






// Creating a visual representation of a React roadmap is a great idea! However, since I can't directly display images here, I'll describe the components of a typical React roadmap that you can consider creating. You can then use various tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Lucidchart, or other diagramming tools to actually create the visual.

// Here's a textual representation of a React roadmap:

// 1. Basic Concepts:

// JSX (JavaScript XML)
// Components and Props
// State and Lifecycle
// Handling Events
// 2. State Management:

// Local State
// React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
// Redux for Global State
// 3. Routing:

// React Router for Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
// 4. Styling:

// CSS-in-JS libraries (Styled Components, Emotion)
// CSS Pre-processors (Sass, Less)
// CSS Modules
// 5. Advanced Topics:

// Context API for Propagation
// Error Boundaries
// Higher Order Components (HOCs)
// Render Props
// 6. Testing:

// Unit Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
// Integration Testing
// 7. Server Communication:

// RESTful API Calls
// GraphQL and Apollo Client
// 8. Performance Optimization:

// Memoization
// React.PureComponent and React.memo
// Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
// 9. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):

// Next.js framework
// 10. Mobile App Development:

// React Native
// 11. Internationalization and Localization (i18n):

// 12. Accessibility (a11y) Considerations:

// 13. Deployment:

// Hosting React Apps (Netlify, Vercel)
// CI/CD Integration
// Remember, this is a broad outline and the order might vary depending on your specific needs and goals. Each of these components can be represented with a chart or a section in a diagram, highlighting the key concepts and technologies involved.

// You can use online diagramming tools to create a flowchart or a roadmap diagram. Just place the topics in boxes or circles and connect them with arrows to represent their sequence or dependencies. You can also add brief descriptions or icons to each box to make it more visually informative.
